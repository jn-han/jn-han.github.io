      "'plotgen' drew inspiration from the storytellers and artists who excite, move and thrill us with the magic that can be found in their work. We wanted to empower others with the same kind of magic that is now realizable with AI developments like LLMs and Diffusion Models. Seeing how new tools from companies like BentoML and Cohere make it easy for developers to build products from these developments, we knew we had to do something in the space of generative AI.",

      "Drawing on my hands-on experience in shipping and receiving logistics at Aritzia, I developed Freyt to streamline and optimize retail logistics operations. Freyt enables businesses to efficiently track, log, and visualize essential key performance indicators (KPIs) related to shipping and receiving. By providing actionable insights and clear data visualizations, the platform empowers managers to identify operational bottlenecks, uncover process improvement opportunities, and recognize high-performing employees. Over time, Freyt aims to support data-driven decision making, helping retail teams enhance productivity, drive accountability, and continuously improve their logistics workflows.",

This inspired me to develop an all-in-one application tailored to the needs of volleyball leagues and tournaments.",

  //   // The app streamlines the entire tournament experience. Organizers can easily communicate essential information, such as court assignments, schedules, and venue details. Players, in turn, can log their match results through a peer verification system, ensuring that scores are accurate and mutually agreed upon. The platform then automatically updates court availability, tracks which teams advance or are eliminated, and provides real-time updates for all participants. The result is a transparent, efficient, and intuitive tool designed to simplify volleyball event management for everyone involved.
